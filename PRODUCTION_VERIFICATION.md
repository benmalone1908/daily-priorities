  - Look for: `✅ Supabase client initialized successfully`
  - Should NOT see: `ℹ️ Supabase credentials not configured`

- [ ] **Data loads automatically**
  - Should show "67,000+ records (complete)" or similar
  - Should NOT show file upload screen
  - Data should appear without uploading CSV

- [ ] **Historical data accessible**
  - Filter by date range (July 2024 onwards)

  - Use `VITE_AUTH_USERNAME` and `VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD`
  - Should successfully authenticate

### **display-forecaster Production**

Open your production URL and verify:

- [ ] **App loads without errors**

   - Should appear immediately after refresh

3. [ ] **Upload test in display-forecaster**
   - Upload a different CSV
   - Note the campaign names

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Supabase credentials not configured"
**Cause**: Environment variables not loaded
**Fix**:
1. Check Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
3. Trigger redeployment

### Issue: "No data loading" or shows upload screen
**Cause**: Database empty or query failing
**Fix**:
1. Verify migration was applied (check Supabase table editor)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify environment variables are correct

### Issue: "Different record counts in each app"
**Cause**: Cache or timing issue
**Fix**:
1. Hard refresh both apps (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check both apps are using same Supabase URL

### Issue: "Login fails"
**Cause**: Wrong credentials or env vars not set
**Fix**:
1. Double-check `VITE_AUTH_USERNAME` and `VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD` in Vercel
2. Ensure no extra spaces in values
3. Redeploy after fixing

## 📊 Expected Production Behavior

### On First Load:
```
1. User opens campaign-trends
2. Login screen appears
3. Enter credentials → Authenticated
4. App loads from Supabase automatically
5. Shows "67,000+ records" message
6. Dashboard displays with all historical data
```

### Daily Workflow:
```
Morning:
1. Open campaign-trends (or display-forecaster)
2. Upload today's CSV file
3. Data appears in that app immediately

Later:
4. Open the other app (or refresh if already open)
5. Today's data is there automatically
6. No duplicate upload needed!
```
